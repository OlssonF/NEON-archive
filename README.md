# NEON-archive

This currently includes code for pulling data from AWS to archive the NEON Challenge data (does a couple of preliminary checks for duplicates and missing data) and zips today. Data are pulled and zipped by variable for forecasts and scores.

There is also an example script showing how you would download, unzip, and access the parquet files (example uses the Zenodo sandbox for testing).
